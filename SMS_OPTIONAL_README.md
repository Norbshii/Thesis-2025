2. **Don't add** `SEMAPHORE_API_KEY`
3. App works perfectly
4. No SMS costs
5. **Cost: FREE** 🆓

### **Option B: Add SMS Later**
1. When budget allows:

   - Add `SEMAPHORE_API_KEY` to Render
2. SMS activates automatically
3. No code changes needed!

## 📊 **Current Behavior:**

| Scenario | Guardian Phone | SMS API Key | Result |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Student has phone | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ SMS sent |
| Student has phone | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ⚠️ Sign-in works, no SMS |
| No guardian phone | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Sign-in works, no SMS |
| No guardian phone | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Sign-in works, no SMS |

**Bottom line:** Sign-in ALWAYS works! SMS is just a bonus feature.

## 💡 **Student Experience:**

### **When Signing In:**
1. **Success Message**:
   ```
   "Signed in successfully (On time)"
   ```

2. **If No Guardian Phone**:
   ```
   "Signed in successfully (On time)"
   Note: Add guardian phone to receive SMS alerts
   ```

3. **If SMS Sent**:
   ```
   "Signed in successfully (On time)"
   SMS sent to guardian ✓
   ```

   ```
