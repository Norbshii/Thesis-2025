## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Location unavailable"
**Cause:** Your device doesn't have GPS or location services disabled

**Solutions:**
- **Desktop/Laptop:** Location may be less accurate, but should still work. Try again.
- **Phone/Tablet:** 
  - Go to device Settings → Location → Enable Location Services
  - Make sure Wi-Fi is enabled (improves location accuracy)
  - Try moving to a location with better GPS signal (near a window or outside)

### Issue 2: "Location request timed out"
**Cause:** GPS is taking too long to get a fix

**Solutions:**
- Move closer to a window or go outside
- Wait a few seconds and try again
- Enable Wi-Fi (even if not connected) for better location accuracy
- Restart your browser

### Issue 3: "Location permission denied"
**Cause:** You previously blocked location access

**Solutions:**
- Follow the "Check Site Settings" instructions for your browser above
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try in an incognito/private window
- Reset site permissions

### Issue 4: Works on phone but not on desktop
**Cause:** Desktop/laptop location is less accurate

**Solutions:**
- **For production use:** Use your phone or tablet (more accurate GPS)
- **For testing:** Desktop location works fine, just less accurate
- Make sure Wi-Fi is enabled on your desktop for better location
